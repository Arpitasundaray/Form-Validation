#Form Validation
The form includes various fields such as username, full name, email, phone number, password, confirm password,
date of birth, gender, address, city, state, zip code, country, profile picture, security question, and security answer.
The form also includes a terms and conditions checkbox and a submit button.

The JavaScript code uses the needs-validation class to validate the form fields on submission. It also includes custom validation 
functions for username, full name, email, phone number, and password.
